### Learn about my process

Firstly, I want to say that I had a ton of fun building this project. This project brouhgt back memories of when I first began coding and pure css was all that I knew. As I proigressed through my career, I began to use a variety of styling libraries and although they are great to work with they certainly come with unexpected effect of exercising pure css styling. It was great to get back to my foundation with css and also freshen up on api calls.

Some of the main decisions I made with this project was utilizing hooks such as useState and useEffect. In hindsight, I could have refactored my api call into a custom hook or possibly made use of useAsync. I chose to use this hooks to manage and update my state because of their simplicity. I focused my efforts on making a good user experience and overcoming errors. I wanted this to be a straightforward, easy to use product so I made sure that I could inform the user on how to properly use the tool and also when they weren't. I'm glad that the functionality is present. I can use this as a foundation to refactor at a later time.
